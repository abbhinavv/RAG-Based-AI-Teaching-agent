Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And now I will make a new folder whose name is Video 6. Video 6. And here in Video 6, I will open VS Code as always. And the thing I am going to tell you today is very important from the aspect of SEO. First of all, I want to tell you what is SEO? SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. If you see any website, it has SEO in it. Let's take the example of Amazon.in. I opened Amazon.in. So Amazon.in wants this website to be loaded as soon as possible. So that their products can be searched. Google is a search engine. Google's responsibility is to show the best pages to the users. So Google wants to show only those pages that are fast. They present the information very well. And along with that, there are some things in them that the user has a good experience. For example, let's say there are two pages. One page has told about dog food. The other page has also told exactly the same thing about dog food. But the page 2 of these two is loaded very fast. It loads well. So Google will give it more preference. Along with that, there are core web vitals. Which Google considers to rank two pages. First of all, it is content. Content is the most important. What do you have on one page? If your content is good, then maybe your website can rank without core web vitals. But if you are competing with a page that has presented almost similar quality content. Then your core web vitals will be seen. And if your core web vitals are good, then you will be given preference. So the first thing that comes in the core web vitals is your CLS. You see this video here. Which I have run from web.dev website. You will see that someone comes to your website. And he is trying to cancel the order here. And by mistake, the time he canceled, this thing above became visible. And he shifted the layout. And the order is complete. But the user wanted the order to be incomplete. He wanted to click on no. In this case, the user experience is very bad. And as you saw in this video, it should not be like this. That's why our CLS should be as low as possible. Now what is the definition of CLS? Cumulative layout shift means. How much is shifting while the page is loading. Assume that you have loaded the page. And first of all, you get to see this. It was above first. And after that, when this keyterm part was loaded. So everything shifted down. The layout should not shift. If you put width and height in images. Then the layout will not shift. The next metric we are going to talk about is LCP. And LCP stands for Largest Contextual Paint. This means that if the user is viewing a page. Then the biggest element on it. For example, the biggest part in this is this image. How long is it loading? Means the whole page will be loaded. But the biggest looking element. Which is the most important. How long is it loading? According to web.dev and Google. A good LCP score should be 2.5 seconds. Means the biggest element should be loaded in 2.5 seconds. After this comes the third metric which is FID. Which stands for First Input Delay. First Input Delay means that. If any user has clicked on any input element. Like on a button or any type of input on a page. So how long does that input process? For example, if you click on a button. So how long does that button click browser process? And according to Google and web.dev. Your input should start processing in less than 100 milliseconds. So these were the three core web vitals. Which are very important. For your information. These core web vitals are updated. But these three are very important. And you should know. Now I will show you. What is a lighthouse report? And why do they generate? And how will these three core web vitals get their value from there? So I will tell you here. If you will inspect by right clicking. And you might have it on the right side. So you can click here and bring it down. By clicking here. If you want you can bring it here again. And by clicking here you can bring it down. I prefer it down. Because I am used to seeing it down from the starting. Now you can see the option of lighthouse here. Lighthouse basically generates a report for you. And tells you what can be improved in your HTML page. For example, if I want to see here in mobile. How mobile users are seeing my website. So I will click on mobile. Or I will click on desktop. I will close this tab. I will click on mobile. And I will click on analyze page load. So this will generate a report for me. Lighthouse. You can see here that a report has been generated. In this performance, accessibility, best practices, SE and PWA. All these things are being shown. Now you can see here that some things are shown in red. That is, the scope of improvement is in the page. Now you can see here that it is telling you to size your images properly. Your website can be loaded 2.7 seconds fast. So all these suggestions are given to you. By lighthouse. And if you incorporate these suggestions. Then your website will be loaded very well. And will give a good experience to the user. Now you can see here that image elements do not have explicit width and height. So you should give width and height. The width and height attribute of the image. Which we read in the last video. You should use that. So that your browser has space. When we set width and height in HTML. Then the space is reserved in the browser. Otherwise, if we do not set height and width. Then what will happen. Our browser will not know how much space to reserve. And as long as CSS will load. The whole page will shift from top to bottom. So we don't want our page to shift during loading time. If our page starts shifting. So if we are going to click here. So when it will shift by mistake. It is possible that we click here. Suppose an image was going to come here. I am going to click here. And as soon as I clicked. During that time. This image was loaded. And all this content shifted down. And instead of clicking here by mistake. I will click on the image. This is called cumulative layout shift. So this kind of shift. Is not preferred at all. Google does not prefer at all. And this should be the least. You can see that the space is very less. Cumulative layout shift. So we have to keep the cumulative layout shift as little as possible. So that our user can get a very good experience. So here we get a lot of suggestions. And this is for our mobile. Now we can generate a desktop report. And the desktop report will be generated. So as you can see. That it has generated a report. 92 marks in performance. 100 out of 82 in accessibility. 75 in best practices. 75 in SEO. Now you see here. That the good things are told here. And the scope of improvement. Lighthouse tells you. So this is a hidden tool. Which we should all use. Now I want to tell you. About meta tags and meta description. So what I will do here. That I will make a new file. I will name it index.html. And after making an HTML file. The first SEO element I want to tell you. That is title. If your title is reflecting the content of your page. So this is a very good SEO practice. Whenever your page is changing. You make the title in such a way. That it reflects the content of your page. Because if you want your website on Google. Then it will come according to the title. The index of Google. Like you guys write here. Code with Harry. Okay. And you write like this. So this thing is the title of the page. Which is put by YouTube. This title is of the page. Which is put by Instagram. This title is of the page. Which is put by GitHub. So if the title is put on the page. And the title actually. Which reflects the content of your page. Then your website will rank very well. Now let's say I put content here. And I put an h1. And I write here Harry. And after that let's say. I write a paragraph here. And I write here lorem 45. Now why did I write lorem 45? I will do view word wrap. Why did I write 45? This is a very good question. I wrote 45 because I am lazy. And 4 and 5 are around. So I doubled 4 and 5. I also write 23. Because they are also around. Okay. So there is no other reason. Now I will preview it quickly here. I will open in browser here. So see it looks like this. Now this document is written. If I leave it like this. Then this SEO practice will not be good. I will write here about Harry. And I will write here code with Harry. Which is also my website. Okay. And what will happen by doing this? That my title will reflect here. As you can see. So what will happen by doing this kind of work? That my website will have more chances to be seen in Google. By inspecting I will also take out its lighthouse report. And I will see what are the scope of improvements. Now its lighthouse report will come very big. Because there is nothing in it that I should improve. But when I put images etc. Then I will get suggestions. Like put width. Put height. Along with that I will tell you one more trick. With which you can see your website in any mobile. You will find out. So you guys click here. Can you see the computer here? Click on this. And after this if you choose responsive. Then you can see that. How your website will be seen in any kind of device. So your website is responsive or not. You can see it here by doing this. If you go to see in a specific device. Like in iPhone 12 Pro. Your website will look like this in iPhone 12 Pro resolution. Now don't say why there is no 15 or 16 in it. 12 Pro means big iPhone device. Understand okay. In such a big device. In such a big device. How will your website look? This is simply being told to you guys. So now you guys can see. How it will look in Surface Pro 7. By clicking here. How it will look in Google phones. You can also find out this. And if you want to take a general view. Your website in responsive device. In any kind of device. Like how it will look in iPad. Now if you don't have a device here. Then you choose responsive. And take out the approximate width of your device. In total, your website should look good in all the width devices. How does this happen? I will tell you later in this course. Now if you click here again. Then it will close. The responsive view is closed. And as soon as it closes. Your website looks like this. I will close it. I will come back here. Now I will tell you about Meta Text. Here I will write like Meta. So look here Meta DESC is coming. Okay. I will click on Meta DESC. And here I can give the description of my page. Suppose I give. This is the page. This is a page about. This is a page which contains description. About Harry. Okay. And here you can write whatever page content you have. Whatever you want. Like I show you. Suppose you write what is SEO. Okay. What is SEO. You have written. And look here. This page has put this Meta Description. SEO stands for this in simple terms. Now it is not necessary that a search engine. Will parse your Meta DESC. It will not do this. If it likes it. Then it will parse and keep your Meta DESC here. If you have not put Meta DESC. Then Meta DESC can be generated from your content. So this is the responsibility of the search engine. What will Bing do? What will Google do? But our page should be absolutely to the point. Especially if we are writing a blog. And we want our page to rank organically. So here you can see. That I put Meta DESC. Now a Meta Keyword used to run a lot earlier. But now the Meta Keyword. That. Has been deprecated. Meta Keyword is not used at all now. The code of Meta Keywords looks like this. But it is believed that. Meta Keywords. They do not rank at all in SEO. Because people abuse it more. Suppose you have written a page. About pets. And you have written. What is SEO in Meta Keyword. So it is not that your page will be ranked. I am here. The double quotes are wrong. I fix them. So if I put Meta Keyword here. Then it is not necessary. That the search engine will consider it. Some search engines do this. That they do not believe in Meta Keywords. They say. We do not want to see your Meta Keywords. You do not put it. So Meta Keywords used to run a lot earlier. But now it does not work. Now the content of your page is being parsed. And now the time of AI is coming. So especially more. Your content will be understood. What value is your content giving. It will be understood. Accordingly it will be ranked. Now if you want to know exactly. About these Core Web Vitals. For example. If I do the right thing. And inspect. And go to Lighthouse. And for the desktop. I take out the Lighthouse report. So some Core Web Vitals come. Like LCP comes. Then after that. FCP comes. First Contextual Paint. Now you can see here. Everything is 100. 100. 100. 100. Look here. There was not much in this content. But here you can see. What is he saying. What are you doing. Pages with Websocket. Cannot enter. Back Forward Cache. There is Websocket in this. Because we are using this extension. Live Preview. Otherwise this is absolutely right. Accessibility is 100. Everything is 100. This is a very good page. PWA is Progressive Web Apps. Which we will not make now. But you see here. First Contextual Paint. Largest Contextual Paint. Total Blocking Time. Cumulative Layout Shift. Speed Index. If you want to know about all this. Like what is First Contextual Paint. That what is going to be seen by the user. How long has it been painted on the browser. So if you want to see this thing. Then you will have to go to web.dev. Web.dev is a very good website. Which talks about all these things. And you can see here. That they keep talking about it. You can see here. You can see here. You can see here. You can see here. And you can see here. That they keep talking about it. You can learn here. About all these things. What is it? What is it? If you want to learn PWA. Then you can learn PWA. About all these things. Here. A lot of good content is put. But we are in this course. HTML, CSS, JavaScript. We will focus on making websites. This thing. According to me. You should have come. Because of which. I told you about it. If you have not yet. Sigma Web Development Series. Have not accessed. Then definitely access it. Access the playlist. Bookmark it. Or click on it. And then. You can see. Here. Bookmark it. Click on the star here. And click here to save. That's all for now in this video. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you. Next time. Thank you for watching it."
