I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks
 containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"name":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work .mp3","number":"1","start":1509.26,"end":1512.26,"text":" we will learn html, css, javascript"},{"name":"Heading, Paragraphs and Links .mp3","number":"4","start":366.32,"end":368.32,"text":" What is the main heading page? HTML introduction."},{"name":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work .mp3","number":"1","start":1467.26,"end":1470.26,"text":" you will learn html, css, javascript"},{"name":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work .mp3","number":"1","start":1216.26,"end":1219.26,"text":" so html has a video tag"},{"name":"Heading, Paragraphs and Links .mp3","number":"4","start":276.32,"end":278.32,"text":" In HTML, there are headings up to H6."},{"name":"Basic Structure of an HTML Website .mp3","number":"3","start":207.24,"end":208.6,"text":" There are two types of tags in HTML,"},{"name":"Basic Structure of an HTML Website .mp3","number":"3","start":184.08,"end":185.64,"text":" then we write HTML tag."}]

"where is html heading tags taught in the course?"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above
 format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp)
   and guide the user to go to that particular video.Exact timestamps (convert seconds to minutes and seconds). If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only 
   answer questions related to the course
