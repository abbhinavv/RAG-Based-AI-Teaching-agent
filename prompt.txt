I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks
 containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"name":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work .mp3","number":"1","start":1503.26,"end":1518.26,"text":" and i will teach you many things in this course  we have 2-4 people here  we will learn html, css, javascript  and i will teach you tricks  that you have never heard"},{"name":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML .mp3","number":"5","start":728.64,"end":738.64,"text":" I can group it.  I can put it in T head.  Along with that, the content inside the table  will come inside the T body.  So what will come inside the T body?"},{"name":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML .mp3","number":"5","start":480.64,"end":492.64,"text":" And yes, I know it is ugly.  But you guys just understand that the table works like this.  Now there are row span and col span attributes.  And here you can see that row span means  how many rows will be spanned by your td."},{"name":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML .mp3","number":"5","start":787.64,"end":799.64,"text":" Your whole table, head content will come here.  Foot content will come here.  And body content, in fact, comes in between head and foot.  But you can write it here in any way.  But ideally head, body and then foot comes."},{"name":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML .mp3","number":"5","start":366.64,"end":377.64,"text":" Table tag is very useful in HTML.  I will tell you what happens with table tag.  You get to see a table from table tag.  Now I will copy this table from here.  And when I copy this table from here,"},{"name":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work .mp3","number":"1","start":1488.26,"end":1503.26,"text":" i will teach you only that matters  we are going to learn what matters  i have designed this course  so that you can learn only that matters  and you can learn other things from practice"},{"name":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML .mp3","number":"5","start":418.64,"end":425.64,"text":" So what is this?  I will tell you how it works.  So here you see that we used table tag.  Table tag has a tr tag inside.  Which is the table row."}]

"where are tables taught in the course"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above
 format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp)
   and guide the user to go to that particular video.Exact timestamps (convert seconds to minutes and seconds). If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only 
   answer questions related to the course
